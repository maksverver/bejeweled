- Test robustness of test case input functions.

- When loading the game definition, crop the field to minimum dimensions,
  and keep a start row/col to generate correct moves
  (important: TEST THIS!)

To implement:
- Write code to generate random test cases from templates
- Generate a bunch of meaningful test cases
- Keep test scores for different revisions to see if we're
  actually making progress.

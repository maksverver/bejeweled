- Test robustness of test case input functions.

To implement:
- Adhere to time limit (auto-quit after expiration)

- Write code to generate random test cases from templates
- Generate a bunch of meaningful test cases
- Keep test scores for different revisions to see if we're
  actually making progress.

- Try alternative state valuation: highest score/move ratio?
- Try forcing progress by kicking states with few moves
   (e.g. after 1 of 15 minutes, remove states with less than
         10,000/15 moves)
